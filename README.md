## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create your own `config.js` file in the project root (see below).
3. Open `homepage.html` in your browser to explore the app.

## Configuration

This project requires a `config.js` file in the root directory with your API keys and endpoints.  
**Do not commit this file to version control.**

**Example `config.js`:**
```js
window.APP_CONFIG = {
  API_URL: "YOUR_API_URL", // The endpoint for user registration and authentication (e.g., a REST API for user data)
  EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID: "YOUR_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID", // Your EmailJS service ID for sending emails (e.g., password reset)
  EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID: "YOUR_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID", // Your EmailJS template ID for email templates
  EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY: "YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY", // Your EmailJS public key for authentication
  FACEBOOK_APP_ID: "YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID", // (Optional) Facebook App ID for social login
  TWITTER_TOKEN: "YOUR_TWITTER_TOKEN" // (Optional) Twitter token for social login
};
```

**Key Descriptions:**
- `API_URL`: The endpoint where users are registered, authenticated, and managed. This should point to your backend or user management API.
- `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`, `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`, `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`: Used for sending emails (like password resets) via [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
- `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`: (Optional) Used for Facebook social login integration.
- `TWITTER_TOKEN`: (Optional) Used for Twitter social login integration.

**Important:**
- Each user must create their own `config.js` with their own credentials for the app to function.

## API & Key Configuration

> **Security Notice:**
> - This repository does **not** include any real API endpoints or keys.
> - All sensitive values in the code are replaced with placeholders such as `YOUR_API_URL_HERE`, `YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, and `YOUR_TWITTER_TOKEN`.
> - **Before running or deploying the app, you must replace these placeholders with your own credentials.**
> - Never commit your real API keys or sensitive endpoints to a public repository.

**Relevant files to update:**
- `scripts/authService.js` (look for `YOUR_API_URL_HERE`)
- `registeredusers.html` (look for `YOUR_API_URL_HERE`)
- `login.html`, `forgotpassword.html`, `homepage.html`, `scripts/main.js` (look for `YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, `YOUR_TWITTER_TOKEN`)

## EmailJS Integration

This project uses [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send password reset emails directly from the frontend.

**Configuration required:**
- You must provide your own EmailJS Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key.
- In the code, you will see placeholders like:
  - `'YOUR_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID'`
  - `'YOUR_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID'`
  - `'YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY'`

**Relevant files to update:**
- `forgotpassword.html`
- `scripts/main.js`

**Example usage in code:**
```js
await emailjs.send(
  'YOUR_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID',
  'YOUR_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID',
  {
    email: email,
    link: resetLink
  },
  'YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY'
);
```
